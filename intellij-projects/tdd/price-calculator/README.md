# Price Calculator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Price Calculator project! This is a simple Java application designed to help you get started with Test-Driven Development (TDD). 
The project is only a template to allow for a starting point to focus on TDD part. 
By following the TDD approach, we will write tests first and then implement the necessary code to make those tests pass.
